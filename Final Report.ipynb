        "In this project, we choose to apply various search methods to the Pac-man game. Pac-man is a maze arcade game created in 1980 by Namco [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man). Pac-man is a character that must placed in a maze that must collect pieces and find the exit (the goal) without being caught by moving ghosts. We set two objectives in this project. The first one aims to experiment with each one of the search method in a practical way. Secondly, we want to determine which search algorithm, among the ones we selected, is best suited for the Pac-man game, according to the metrics and game conditions considered we will present shortly. \n",

        "In order to implement the Pac-man game, we decided to do the following modelization. \n",
        "\n",
        "The main goal of the problem is to find a path that leads to the goal in order to solve the maze and finish the game. A second objective of Pac-man is to collect as many points as possible while progressing inside the maze.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also defined a set of rules. First, Pac-man can move freely inside the white spaces in the maze. However, it can't go back and revisit already visited nodes. As with the original game, there are ghosts inside the map. For simplification, we make the assumption that the ghosts  are static and thus can't move. The problem is therefore deterministic, we can fully determine the next state of the game given the current state as well as the action chosen by Pac-man. \n",
        "\n",
        "Under those conditions, Pac-man will reason about the solution before actually adopting it. That means that, even before the game starts, we execute any of the search method to select a path from the starting position to the goal position. Once the search is complete, we provide a list of actions for Pac-man to follow in order to solve the maze. \n",
        "\n",
        "The other two important game conditions, whether there is a countdown (a time limit) for Pac-man to reach the goal, or Pac-man must collect the maximum number of points, will be discussed later in the report. Those two conditions will guide us in determining which search method is more appropriate by adopting either one of those constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we briefly discuss some of the most important elements of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The maze:** In the game, there is a maze where Pac-man\n",
        "has to collect as many pieces (we use the term \"points\" in this project) as possible without being caught by one of the ghosts. The maze is defined in\n",
        "terms of a grid. The black-areas, in a Pac-Man game, are non-traversable walls. They are represented as a sequence of # symbols in the project. The pieces that Pac-man must collect in the maze are represented as \"P\" letters in our mazes. We also note that, under our game conditions, the ghosts present in the mazes are frozen. This means that they can't move and, for simplicity, we decided to replace them with walls. Pac-man can't go through them that way. Below is an exemple of a representation of a maze. When the game begins, Pac-man starts at the position described with the \"S\" letter, and must finish the game by reaching the goal position (\"G\" letter in the maze). Below, we give more details about the implementation of the maze inside the file \"map.py\". We also wish to note that, in the project, we use the term \"map\" to designate the maze.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Actions:** In this game, there are in total 4 possible actions that Pac-man can choose: left, right, down or up in that order. Depending on the position of Pac-man in the maze, there might be fewer actions allowed. For instance, if Pac-man reaches a wall, only sideway movements are allowed. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Nodes:** each white element on the maze represents a position Pac-man can go by. We identify them as nodes in the project. Each node has a state, a position (defined by a pair of two elements (i, j) representing its row and column positions inside the map), a number of points (for simplicity, there is only a maximum of one point per node), a path cost (cost to reach that node from a parent node), and successors. Successors are defined as a list of nodes where Pac-man can move next by selecting any of the actions available.    \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, in order to implement and evaluate the search methods for the problem described, we use the AIMA\n",
        "function library [2].\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note on the nodes explored:** During any of the search selected, we keep track of the nodes explored using a set. The set contains lists of all nodes visited as a sequence. Since a given node can have as many as 4 parents, Pac-man can visit the same node from different paths. This means that the same node can be present in various lists inside the set of explored nodes. However, the same node can't be present more than once inside the same list, thus preventing any infinite loop from happening.\n",

We designed 9 different maps, classified under two groups. The first group is composed of 4 maps: map4, map10, map11 and map12. Those are totally empty maps. Meaning they contain no walls inside them. The second group is composed of 5 maps containing walls placed ramdomly.\n",

        "5. Expanded nodes per second (Expanded nodes/sec):\n",
        "6. Action: it's the total number of actions has to take in order to go from the initial position to the goal\n",
        "7. Points: it's the number of points Pac-man collected in its path to the goal\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of nodes metric will help us measure the memory used by each search method to find a solution.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "We run each search method against each map 10 times. This will help us build confidence intervals on each metric. \n",
        "\n",

It's a MacBook Air containing a 1.6 GHz Intel Core I5, and 8 Gb of RAM.

        "\n",
        "One of the method adopted to solve the Pac-man game is the local beam search. It's an algorithm that keeps track of k states. \n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective is to find the goal, and, if the goal isn't found yet, to collect as many points along the path to the goal as possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since the local beam search grabs k good neighbor states without thinking ahead about where to go next, this algorithm is greedy. In fact, it tries to increase the objective function defined as the number of collected points (the optimization problem). Under this method, the path to the goal is irrelevant. \n",
        "\n",
        "The way the search method works is that it selects the k best successors according to the number of points they contain. During the search, only k states are kept in memory every time we expand new nodes. This method is particularly suitable on devices with very limited memory. \n",
        "\n",
        "If collecting as many points as possible is important, the local beam search method is an appropriate algorithm for this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The steps for this algorithm are the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   we begin with k randomly generated states,\n",
        "2.   all the successors of all the k states are generated,\n",
        "1.   if any of the successors is the goal, the algorithm stops\n",
        "2.   else we select the k best successors from the complete list of successors ranked by the number of points each node contains, and \n",
        "1.   we repeat the process from step 2\n",
        "\n",
        "An important hypothesis we make is that before starting the local beam search, we have no detail about the map, its size, structure or any other information that could give a clue about the maze. \n",
        "\n",
        "Also, since the number of possibilities can quickly get high as we progress inside the map, we set a value of 10 for the width. We select the 10 best successors at each time during the search. We choose k = 10 for two reasons. First, we select the best nodes from where to collect points, while having a raisonnable chance of finding the goal. If after the search ends, it doesn't find a solution, we increase the value of k by 5 and start a new search from the initial position \"S\". This process continues until the search either finds a solution or k reaches the maximum value of 5010 (at this value, there is a reasonable confidence we explored the entire map without finding the goal, provided the map is dense and has't a too large size). \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, the local beam search is selected, in this problem, to maximize the objective function which is the number of points collected. By design, during each step, the search select the k best immediates neighbors of the k current states. The ranking is made according to the number of points each successor contains. Thus, theoretically, we expect that the local beam search will give good results, among all the search methods implemented in the problem, if we consider only the number of points collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "On another perspective, if we imagine a map with points concentrated in a region of the map opposite to the goal, then the search will naturally progress to the region containing those points before heading back to the goal state. As a result, the solution path, according to the local beam search, would end up being longer than the one found by other methods (especially information searches using the Euclidean distance from the current node to the goal state).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since only k nodes are expanded when exploring the map, the path to the goal could be discarded (the unique path to the goal contains no points to collect for instance). Thus, there is no guarantee to find a solution with a given value of k, and therefore the local beam search isn't complete. To solve that issue in the context of the current problem, we start a new search by increasing the value of k until either all of the nodes are explored or we reach a solution. By increasing each time the value of k, we increase the number of successors kept in memory at each step of the process. Thus, the local beam search becomes more and more like the breadth-first search method.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Completeness:** No, this strategy doesn't guarantee it will find a solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Optimization:** No, this strategy doesn't guarantee it will find the optimal solution (finding the path that collects the maximum number of points possible under the game conditions).\n",
        "\n",
